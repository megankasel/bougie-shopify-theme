At the time, I had just launched my eco-friendly building materials company, aRideaux Construction, and was exploring creative ways to fund it. Around the same time, I was planning my birthday and searching for eco-friendly products I love—like bamboo bath towels and those gorgeous leaf plates that completely stole my heart.<\/p><p>As I searched, I realized how hard it was to find stylish, eco-friendly items for everyday living, especially clothing. That’s when it clicked: why not create a store where everything I love—beautiful, sustainable, and eco-friendly—could be in one place?<\/p><p>I first named the store “VerdeRoot,” but it didn’t feel quite right. I wanted the name to reflect both my love for nice things (my nieces and nephews call me “bougie”) and my deep connection to nature (my sister affectionately calls me a “tree hugger”). And so, Bougie & Green was born—a perfect blend of my passion for sustainability and my appreciation for life’s finer things.<\/p><p>Bougie & Green isn’t just a store; it’s a vision for making eco-friendly living simple, stylish, and accessible. It’s a reflection of who I am and the world I want to create—one that values sustainability without sacrificing beauty or quality.<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["heading_VJY7ei","text_4ntjYE"],"settings":{"desktop_content_position":"left","content_alignment":"left","color_scheme":"","full_width":true,"padding_top":40,"padding_bottom":52}},"rich_text_JKfLtK":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"heading_GNfm3K":{"type":"heading","settings":{"heading":"<strong>Vision<\/strong>","heading_size":"h1"}},"text_XkWDhR":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>Bougie & Green is your go-to destination for eco-friendly products that bring creativity and sustainability into every part of your life.
